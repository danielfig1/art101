			<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
			<h2>Lab Summary</h2>
			<p>This lab was meant to familiarize us with creating and editing local file structures and index.html files. </p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>So far everything has been easy to understand! The only trouble I ran into was accidentally creating hyperlinks to blank labs. To fix this, I looked up what the 'a' tag is and deleted it from the HTML.</p>
			<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>This is what my ART101 file structure looks like:</p>
