				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The first problem was finding labs to debug. I always made sure that my code worked as intended before submitting. After going through all of them, I couldn't find anything to change.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I was given the idea to recount times where debugging helped me turn in working products.</p>

				<h2>Debugging</h2>
				<p>Sometimes I needed a second pair of eyes to help me identify why my
					code wasn't working. In Lab 13, even though my conditionals were
					correct, I had them in the wrong order. After trying that out it still
					didn't work. Getting some helped releaved a slot of syntax errors in
					my function, which ended up being the nail in the coffin since my
					website started working way after. </p>
