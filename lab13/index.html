				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>This time around I was making things more complicated for myself. In the lecture, combinations of 3 and 5 just meant checking if 15 was a factor. I had to do the same for this lab, but I didn't know how to incorporate 7. Turns out it was way easier than I was making it out to be and I just had to use the multiples of all three factors in my conditionals.</p>
