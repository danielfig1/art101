			<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<h2>Lab Summary</h2>
			<p>I had to create functions in Javascript, use Anon functions, and use callbacks.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I had a long problem with getting the console log to display my functions. It had to do with the way I was defining the 'results' variable. I had to change it in my JavaScript file to have it display properly.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Peep the console to check out my work!</p>
