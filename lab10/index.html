			<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>

			<h2>Lab Summary</h2>
			<p>Experiment with events and handling input/output in JavaScript.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>At first I really struggled with successfully accepting user input. No matter what I typed in the form, the console kept saying all of my variables were empty. I kept tweaking my index.html and JavaScript file thinking it was a syntax error. However, I neglected to adapt my borrowed function from Lab 7 in order to work for this lab. After doing that it was easy to condense it back down and clean it up.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Try the form out for yourself!</p>

				<div id=form>
					<label for="user-name">Input your name:</label>
					<input id="user-name" name="user-name"><br>
					<button id="my-button">Submit</button>
				</div>

			<p>Your name was changed to: </p>
				<div id="output">
				</div>
