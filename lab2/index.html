			<p> Though my partner Maxton and I are from different sections, we have teamed up to take on Lab 2! Maxton is a third year CS major with experience in multiple coding languages. On the other hand, there is me, Daniel Figueroa, a freshman who barely scraped through CSE 20 and did some messy, inefficient website work for an internship a couple of years ago. I'm always willing to learn more, and I'm glad Maxton has been so patient and open to help me understand this lab assignment! It proves I have more to learn, not just from lectures but from my peers as well.</p>
